
1) Create a __plugin__.py file in your plug-in directory 
 
2) In that file, put: 
  
  id="{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}"
  version="1.0.x.x 
  title="Plug-in Name 
  
3) Zip the __plugin__.py and other .py files into a zip file. 

4) Rename the zip file to MyPlugin.rhi 
 
5) Send it on it's merry way. 

e.g.
id="{1e010ce0-13c0-4a59-8a4f-fb607657962b}"
version="1.0.0.3" 
title="InstallTest" 

Beware: if you have a line that contans a "#" in a string, it will not be properly handled:
// TODO: This does not correctly handle # characters embedded in strings:
//    'title="The #1 Plug-in" # My title has a # in it!'
// becomes
//    'title="The '
